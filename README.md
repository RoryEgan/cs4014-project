# cs4014-project
Group repo for CS4014/Web App Development project.

Overview:

interactive web platform to facilitate the proofreading of student theses,
dissertations, assignments, research papers alike among students and staff. The
main idea behind the website is to allow students to publish their academic documents
and get them proofread/reviewed by peers. Members will create profiles and based
on their actions will gain a reputation score. A reputation of more than 40 results
in the user being promoted to admin.

# The website will have the following pages/fuctionality

## Login page
  -login (ID,
          password)

  -sign up (firstname,
            lastname,
            student/staff ID,
            email,
            subject/field of study,
            password,
            confrirm password)

## Note on setting up permissions for file uploaded
  There may be permission errors trying to uplioad files. To fix this I carried out these commands:

  ```
  chown -R user:www-data yourprojectfoldername

  chmod 775 yourprojectfoldername
  ```

  On the files folder within in the project.
